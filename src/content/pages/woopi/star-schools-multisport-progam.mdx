**Specialty Sports Programs: Sport-Specific or Multi-Sport**

Our specialty sports programs are designed to align with **Australian Curriculum: Health and Physical Education (HPE)** outcomes, offering schools the flexibility to focus on either **sport-specific skill development** (e.g. athletics, football codes, netball, etc.) or **multi-sport participation**.

**More information can be found on [www.star-schools.com.au](www.star-schools.com.au)**

These programs support skill acquisition, game understanding, fitness development, and teamwork, while meeting curriculum goals. They are ideal for both core PDHPE delivery and sport enrichment streams and come with a programs matched to stage PDHPE outcomes.

Star-Schools is also registered for the **Sporting Schools** grant for the following sports: **Athletics, Soccer and Basketball.** However, all coaches and teachers are trained to deliver the **fundamental movement skills session.**&#x20;

**Available in 4, 6 or 10-week blocks**, these sessions are tailored to suit year levels, ability ranges and school timetables.

All sessions are programed, outcome matched and signed off so that teachers can take a break and not have to worry about a thing.&#x20;
