Calling all outdoor enthusiasts and young adventurers! This 4.5-hour camp is packed with exploration, excitement, and epic trail time.

With maps in hand, we’ll split into small teams and set off to locate hidden checkpoints scattered throughout the area. It’s a race against the clock—and each other—to crack the secret codeword of the day. Route choice, teamwork, and quick thinking will be key!

After more food, laughter, and games at base camp, we’ll hit the trails once again for the final leg of our journey, finishing up at the beautiful Red Hill Reserve.
