**Program Outline:**

This 4.5 hour camp is for the outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers! We start with a run exploring the many windy single trails and fire trails we are spoiled with on our Northern Beaches (approx 3-3.5k) as we work our way towards our base camp for the morning. Here we will enjoy some morning tea, some good old fashioned park games, and an orienteering challenge!  Armed with a map, we split into small teams and set on our way to find numbered checkpoints whilst trying to decipher the best route choice to get there! Who will be first back to base and crack the codeword for the day?! After some more food, fun and games, we hit the trails again for the final part of our adventure to our pick up point to conclude the camp for the day. 

*This is most suited to children that are comfortable continuously running/jogging 4-5km*
