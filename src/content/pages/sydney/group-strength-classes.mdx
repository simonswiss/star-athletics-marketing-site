### **Group Strength with Rebound**

Building a well-rounded athlete takes a team—so we’ve partnered with **Rebound Health**, leaders in exercise physiology and physiotherapy, to bring you the highest standard of strength training.

Rebound's **Youth Athlete Program** is designed to help athletes from age 10-18 move better, get stronger, and stay injury-resilient. Under the guidance of Rebound’s expert coaches, every session focuses on correct technique, smart progressions, and developing balanced, functional strength that supports performance in any sport.

Whether you’re aiming to improve power, stability, speed, or long-term athletic development, these classes provide the structure, support, and expertise to help you reach your goals safely and confidently.

Before joining a Group Strength class, all athletes are required to complete an **initial consultation** with Rebound Health.\
This one-on-one session allows their specialist team to assess movement patterns, identify any injury risks, and understand individual goals. It ensures every athlete is placed in the right program, with the right coaching, for safe and effective progress.

Join us and build strength—with a team behind you.
