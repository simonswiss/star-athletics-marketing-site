**Get moving with Star-Athletics – where Mid North Coast kids train smart, get strong, and have fun doing it.**

After two years of working with local athletes, we've seen first-hand the strength, speed, and confidence that comes from consistent, well-structured training—and we’re just getting started.

Each session is led by Heather, who brings energy, experience, and individual focus to every athlete. Whether your child is chasing team sport goals, preparing for school carnivals, or simply looking to stay active and healthy, we’ve got a program to match.

We mix sprint work to sharpen speed, core and strength training to build power, agility drills to boost coordination, and endurance activities that keep kids engaged and improving.

No matter their starting point, every child is supported to push their limits and enjoy the journey.

**Join us at Star-Athletics and discover what your kids are capable of—right here on the Mid North Coast.**
