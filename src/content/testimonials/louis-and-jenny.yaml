  You are the best running coach ever! I love all the fun activities and how
  encouraging you are. Thank you for coaching me - Louis

  It’s been so exciting to watch this group develop under your mentorship,
  Kirsten. Not just the results but the confidence and self belief you give them
  will make such a difference as they take the next step to High School and
  beyond. We really appreciate the positive start you give them on Thursday
  mornings and all the extra support and encouragement you provide

  outside training too ❤❤ - Jenny
