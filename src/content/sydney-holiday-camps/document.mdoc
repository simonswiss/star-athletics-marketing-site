**Program Outline:**

This 4.5 hour camp is for the outdoor enthusiasts and adventurers! We start at Clontarf Reserve, and take a beautiful run along the Spit to Manly track to Tania Park, here we set up our base camp for the morning. After some well earned morning tea, and some park game favourites, we embark on an orienteering challenge through the surrounding area and bush trails!&nbsp; Armed with a map, we split into small teams and set on our way to find numbered checkpoints whilst trying to decipher the best route choice to get there! Who will be first back to base and crack the codeword for the day?! After some more games, we hit the road again for the final part of our trail running adventure taking in the fabulous views of the Sydney Harbour. Camp concludes at North Harbour Reserve.
