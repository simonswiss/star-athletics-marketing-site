Jacob brings the perspective of both athlete and coach to the throws arena. Having competed in track and field for six years — including the past three at the Australian National Championships — he now channels that experience into developing the next generation of throwers. His athletes are already making their mark, earning state-level success and qualifying for National Championships.

Jacob’s coaching philosophy centres on teaching through instructive drills and throwing variations, giving athletes the tools to experiment, discover, and refine what works best for them. He aims to build independent, confident athletes who can step into the competition ring without second-guessing themselves. By blending technical knowledge with athlete autonomy, Jacob creates an environment where throwers can reach their full potential.
