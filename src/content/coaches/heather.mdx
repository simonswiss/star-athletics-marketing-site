Our coaching styles have been incredibly successful, with many athletes representing their state in various sports. It brings me so much joy to witness their growth and achievements!

With 14 years of experience as a PDHPE teacher and a decade of coaching athletics. I bring a contagious level of energy and enthusiasm to everything I do. My coaching journey has taken me from the Vevey Triathlon club in Switzerland to the beautiful Northern Beaches of Sydney, spreading positivity and success in the athletic realm. I've also had the amazing opportunity to delve into speed and agility training for basketball in both Switzerland and Australia. This vibrant experience has given me insights into peak performance and allowed me to tailor my coaching approaches to bring out the best in athletes from various sports.

I'm thrilled to embark on the next chapter of my coaching journey, mastering the components of throws, sprints/hurdles/relays, and middle and distance training throughout 2023 with the Athletics Australia coaching education network. The thrill of expanding my knowledge and skills drives me to provide the utmost care and guidance to my athletes.

So, get ready to join me on this uplifting journey!

Let's achieve greatness together!
