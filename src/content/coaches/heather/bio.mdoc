Hey there! I'm Heather, the founder of Star Athletics, a passion project I started in 2014. My goal is to nurture young athletes, ensuring their well-being and holistic development in sport.

I've also had the amazing opportunity to delve into speed and agility training for basketball in both Switzerland and Australia. This vibrant experience has given me insights into peak performance and allowed me to tailor my coaching approaches to bring out the best in athletes from various sports.

_**Here are my qualifications:**_

I'm thrilled to embark on the next chapter of my coaching journey, mastering the components of throws, sprints/hurdles/relays, and middle and distance training throughout 2023 with the Athletics Australia coaching education network. The thrill of expanding my knowledge and skills drives me to provide the utmost care and guidance to my athletes.

So, get ready to join me on this uplifting journey!
