  Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletic Allstar
  sessions! These fun and engaging sessions are for kids who are new to or
  developing their love for running and athletics and want to:

  * learn correct running technique

  * get fitter, faster and stronger to support their other sports

  * prepare for cross country and athletics carnivals. 


  Our sessions include a mix of sprint, middle distance and cross country
  training (depending on the season) as well as running technique & drills,
  sport specific skills, strength and agility training. 


  Enjoyment is key to engagement and adherence in sport. Whilst teaching correct
  running technique, we incorporate a variety of games, challenges and team
  activities to ensure training is fun and that we are developing the whole
  child by building confidence, social skills, resilience, teamwork, fairness
  and sportsmanship. Children will be safely walked to Curl Curl North Public
  School after the session ensuring you can confidently get on with your day.


  This session is aimed at ages 9-12 so will have more of a technical element
  with some specific and focused training to best prepare for carnivals and
  competition.
