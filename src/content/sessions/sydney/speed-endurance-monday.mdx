Join a squad where young athletes don’t just train—they grow, compete, and have fun together! Every session kicks off with a dynamic, technique based warm-up, then athletes split into sprint and endurance groups to work on their own goals.

**Sprints:**  sharpen acceleration, top-end speed, technique, and power.&#x20;

**Distance:** build aerobic strength, pacing, and speed endurance.&#x20;

Along the way, athletes make friends, share challenges, celebrate progress, and develop a genuine love of running and competing.

This is more than training—it’s about becoming your best self, enjoying every step, and feeling part of a team that supports your journey toward higher-level performance.

Suitable for sprinters, middle distance and cross country runners, and anyone wishing to improve their speed or endurance for sport.
