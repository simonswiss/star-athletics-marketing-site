Fun, play-based sessions that introduce young athletes to running, jumping, throwing, and movement skills. Kids build balance, coordination, and confidence while learning teamwork, developing a love of being active, and getting a head start on school cross country and athletics events.

These sessions will be differentiated to allow for the age and ability level of the participants. This may mean that the group is split for some components of the session to ensure they are being challenged appropriately.
