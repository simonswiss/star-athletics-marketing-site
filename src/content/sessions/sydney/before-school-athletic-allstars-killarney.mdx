Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletic Allstars sessions! Our program is designed to help children learn good run technique, get fitter and faster, and have fun at the same time. Through a variety of activities, team challenges and games, our program promotes teamwork and sportsmanship whilst also improving confidence and social skills. Children will be safely walked to Killarney Heights Public School after the session ensuring you can confidently get on with your day.

Sessions are differentiated to suit the training age and developmental level of the child and ensure they are challenged appropriately and carnival ready!
