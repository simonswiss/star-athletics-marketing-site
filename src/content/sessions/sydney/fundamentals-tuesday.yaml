  Imagine an athletics session for kids that is bursting with excitement,
  laughter, and energy! 


  In our fun-filled FUNdamentals athletics sessions, kids get to explore a wide
  range of activities that develop their movement skills, coordination, and
  fitness. All of these activities are designed to be engaging, inclusive, and
  developmentally appropriate for each child. We teach the foundational run,
  jump and throw skills that allow your child to be athletics carnival ready!


  Throughout our sessions, we celebrate every child's unique abilities and
  interests, and encourage them to discover their own strengths and talents. We
  believe that athletics should be a fun and positive experience, where kids can
  make new friends, learn new skills, and stay active and healthy. So come join
  us for a session of non-stop fun!


  These sessions will be differentiated to allow for the age and ability level
  of the participants. This may mean that the group is split for some components
  of the session to ensure they are being challenged appropriately.
