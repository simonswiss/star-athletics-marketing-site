Our **Performance Squad** is designed for motivated **high school athletes** aiming to take their speed, endurance, and overall athletic performance to the next level. This squad delivers advanced training that supports success in track and field, cross-country, and field-based sports.

Athletes complete a shared warm-up, then break into **speed** and **endurance** streams to target event-specific qualities.\
Speed athletes develop acceleration, max velocity, technical efficiency, strength, and power.\
Endurance athletes build aerobic capacity, race pace control, and high-level speed endurance.

With more challenging sessions, higher training expectations, and a focus on long-term athletic development, this squad is ideal for teens committed to competitive improvement.
