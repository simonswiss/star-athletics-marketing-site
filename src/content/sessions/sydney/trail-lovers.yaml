  We are thrilled to announce our exciting NEW Trail Running weekly sessions
  designed specifically for kids. If your child has a passion for running and a
  love for the great outdoors, our Trail Lovers session is the perfect
  opportunity to nurture their skills and ignite their sense of adventure.


  Not only will your child get to experience the thrill of trail running, and
  explore our beautiful bushland and coastline, it's a great opportunity to
  build friendships with like minded people who LOVE to run.


  This session is a perfect addition to your child's training week to build
  endurance in a chilled no-pressure environment and foster  a love for outdoor
  fitness. Your child will build confidence, and learn about the importance of
  teamwork and perseverance. Each term we will work towards a goal event which
  could be a fun run, cross country, or trail race; this is optional but it is a
  great way for your child to demonstrate commitment, work towards a goal, feel
  empowered, and reap the rewards of achieving their goal as part of a team.


  In addition to your child benefitting physically from Trail Lovers, they will
  also develop a deep appreciation for nature and the environment. They will
  learn about the importance of conservation and leave with a greater
  understanding of their role in preserving our natural spaces.


  Safety is our top priority. We carefully select trails that are suitable for
  young runners, taking into consideration factors such as terrain, difficulty
  level, and accessibility. Our coaches will also educate participants on trail
  etiquette, hydration, and proper warm-up techniques to ensure a safe and
  enjoyable experience for everyone.


  Join us in empowering your child to embrace an active lifestyle, connect with
  nature, and discover the joy of trail running. Spaces are limited, so don't
  miss out on this incredible opportunity. Sign up today and watch your child's
  love for running soar to new heights! üåøüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåÑ
