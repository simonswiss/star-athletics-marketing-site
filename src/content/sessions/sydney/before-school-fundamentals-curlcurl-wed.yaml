  NEW SESSION DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND! STARTS WED 6TH MARCH

  Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletics sessions!
  Following the same format as our FUNdamentals sessions, your child will learn
  the run, jump and throw skills of athletics in a safe, fun, and games based
  environment. Our enthusiastic coaches are passionate about making athletics
  fun and accessible for all kids. With their playful approach and creative
  ideas, they encourage children to challenge themselves, work with their peers,
  and build their confidence. And with the added convenience of safely walking
  your child to Curl Curl North Public School at the end of the session!
price: $16 per session (payable upfront for remainder of term)
