  Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletic Allstar
  sessions! Our program is designed to help children learn good run technique,
  get fitter and faster, and have fun at the same time. Our experienced coaches
  are dedicated to providing a safe and enjoyable environment where kids can
  develop their fitness and athletic skills to ensure your child is well
  prepared for their athletics and cross country carnivals, as well as building
  their speed & agility for sport. Through a variety of activities, team
  challenges and games, our program promotes teamwork and sportsmanship whilst
  also improving confidence and social skills. So come join us and let's have a
  blast while getting fit! Children will be safely walked to Killarney Heights
  Public School after the session ensuring you can confidently get on with your
  day.


  There are two coaches at this session which allows us to differentiate the
  training to suit the training age and developmental level of the child and
  ensure they are challenged appropriately.
