  Aimed at ages 6-10, in our fun-filled athletics sessions, kids get to explore
  a wide range of activities that develop their fundamental movement skills,
  coordination, and fitness. All of these activities are designed to be
  engaging, inclusive, and developmentally appropriate for each child. We teach
  the foundational run, jump and throw skills that allow your child to be
  athletics carnival ready!


  These sessions will be differentiated to allow for the age and ability level
  of the participants. This may mean that the group is split for some components
  of the session to ensure they are being challenged appropriately.
