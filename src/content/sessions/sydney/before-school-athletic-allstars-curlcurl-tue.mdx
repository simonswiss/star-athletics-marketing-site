Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletic Allstars sessions for ages 6-9! In our fun-filled athletics sessions, kids explore a wide range of activities that develop their fundamental movement skills, coordination, and fitness. All of these activities are designed to be engaging, inclusive, and developmentally appropriate for each child. We teach the foundational run, jump and throw skills that allow your child to be athletics carnival ready!

Children will be safely walked to Curl Curl North Public School after the session ensuring you can confidently get on with your day.
