Start the morning right with our energetic Before School Athletic Allstars sessions for ages 6-9! In our fun-filled athletics sessions, kids get to explore a wide range of activities that develop their fundamental movement skills, coordination, and fitness. All of these activities are designed to be engaging, inclusive, and developmentally appropriate for each child. We teach the foundational run, jump and throw skills that allow your child to be athletics carnival ready!

These sessions will be differentiated to allow for the age and ability level of the participants. This may mean that the group is split for some components of the session to ensure they are being challenged appropriately.
