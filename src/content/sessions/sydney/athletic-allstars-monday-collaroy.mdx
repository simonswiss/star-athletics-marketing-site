Learn correct run technique, get fitter and faster, and have fun at the same time. Our experienced coaches are dedicated to providing a safe and enjoyable environment where kids can develop their fitness and athletic skills to ensure your child is well prepared for their athletics and cross country carnivals, as well as building their speed & agility for sport.

Sessions will be differentiated to allow for the training age and developmental level of the participants. This may mean that the group is split for some components of the session to ensure they are being challenged appropriately with some specific and focused training to best prepare for carnivals and competition.
