**New Fundamental Movement Sessions — Preschoolers**\
We’re excited to introduce a new session for preschoolers, focused on developing fundamental movement skills in a fun, supportive environment.

Through games and activities, children will work on balance, coordination, agility, and basic running skills — all while having fun and making friends.

These sessions are perfect for little ones just starting out with structured physical activity, helping build confidence and a love of movement from an early age.

Spaces are limited — message to register your preschooler today! ⭐
