Our sessions are based on the Athletics Australia FIT model training guidelines for long-term athlete development. We aim to provide a fun and engaging environment for children to develop their physical literacy and sport-specific skills. These sessions are designed to be age-appropriate and inclusive, catering to the needs and abilities of each child.

Throughout all stages of long-term athlete development, children are encouraged to have fun, be active, and develop a love of sport and physical activity. Our coaches create a positive and supportive environment that fosters self-confidence, teamwork, and healthy competition.

**TERM 4 2024 DATES:** Monday 14th October to Friday 20th December. REGISTRATIONS OPEN 10 SEPTEMBER!
