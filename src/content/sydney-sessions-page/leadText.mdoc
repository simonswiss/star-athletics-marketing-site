Our sessions are based on the Athletics Australia FIT model training guidelines for long-term athlete development. We aim to provide a fun and engaging environment for children to develop their physical literacy and sport-specific skills. These sessions are designed to be age-appropriate and inclusive, catering to the needs and abilities of each child.

Our **Athletic Allstars** sessions are for those who are developing their love of running and wish to learn correct running technique; get fitter, faster and stronger to support their other sports; and prepare for cross country and athletics carnivals. Sessions include a mix of sprint, middle distance and cross country training (depending on the season) as well as running technique & drills, sport specific skills, strength and agility training.

Our **Development and Track Squads** are for those athletes looking to further develop their skills and improve their performance competitively, whether this be in athletics, cross country or team sport. This session is suitable for sprinters, middle/long distance, and cross country runners and anyone wishing to improve their run technique, speed or endurance for sport. It is a more focused and specialised form of training.
