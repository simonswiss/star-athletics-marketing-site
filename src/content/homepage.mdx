Our classes for children are aimed at developing good technique and a life-long desire to run and stay fit. By planting the seeds for success through individualised goal-setting, children learn about the pleasure of setting and achieving goals â€“ all within a safe, monitored framework.

Teenagers, whose bodies and brains are going through tremendous physical and chemical changes throughout adolescence, benefit from physical challenges that either sharpen their existing sporting skills or establish the fitness foundation that they may not yet have developed.

Achieving personal bests in a social environment outside their usual circle of friends and school peers is very motivating.

Come join the fun - we're looking forward to meeting you!
