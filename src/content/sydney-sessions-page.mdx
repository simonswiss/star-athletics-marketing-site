Our sessions are based on the Athletics Australia FIT model training guidelines for long-term athlete development. We aim to provide a fun and engaging environment for children and teens to develop their physical literacy and sport-specific skills. These sessions are designed to be age-appropriate and inclusive, catering to the needs and abilities of each child.

Our **Athletic Allstars** sessions are for those who are developing their love of running and wish to learn correct running technique; get fitter, faster and stronger to support their other sports; and prepare for cross country and athletics carnivals. Sessions include a mix of sprint, middle distance and cross country training (depending on the season) as well as running technique & drills, sport specific skills, strength and agility training.

Our **Development and Track Squads** are for those athletes aged 10+ looking to further develop their skills and improve their performance competitively, whether this be in athletics, cross country or team sport. This session is suitable for sprinters, middle/long distance, and cross country runners and anyone wishing to improve their run technique, speed or endurance for sport. It is a more focused and specialised form of training.

**Performance Squad** and **Teen Endurance** are HIGH SCHOOL ONLY

**TERM 1 2026 DATES:** Monday 2nd February to Thursday 2nd April 2026 . REGISTRATIONS OPEN Monday 8 December 2026
